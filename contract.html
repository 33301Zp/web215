                I, <a href="introduction.html">Zoe E. Potts</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring WEB215-N801 Advanced Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, Professor D.I.

                I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put 
                information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in 
                assignments may show as absences.
