        <h3>Our mission</h3>
        <h3><em>TAGLINE</em></h3>
        <p>
        Made By is all about teaching people how to crochet. Crochet is one craft that can't be made buy a machine so if you can't 
        buy it you can learn with us how to make it. Almost all inexpensive crochet you see in stores is either not really crochet or made by unethical labor practices. 
        Crochet is a very time consumung process and it's hard on your hands so it should be on the expensive side.
        This brand encourages creativity through crochet. We host crochet classes, how to videos, how to books, and all the supplies you could need. If you don't 
        have the ability or time to make something feel free to browse our shop or commission a member of our team to make one of your ideas.<br>
        
        The theme of Made By is creativity, expression, craftsmanship, learning, and collaboration.
