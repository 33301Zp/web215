            <p>This site introduces me Zoe Potts. I love to be out in nature and to crochet/sew. I'm currently in a degree for 
                full stack programming and I plan to graduate and start working next year. My brand is called <em> Made By, </em> 
                which teaches people how to crochet. You can click <a href="brand.html">Brand Guidelines</a>
                to learn more about the brand. I also have all my GitHub projects and my progress in Codecademy and freeCodeCamp 
                at the bottom of the page. You can click <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> to learn more 
                about me.
